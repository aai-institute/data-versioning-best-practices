    "- [Utilize reusable and tested functions for data transformation.](#utilize-reusable-and-tested-functions-for-data-transformation)\n",
    "- [Use commits to save checkpoints and merges for atomic changes.](#use-commits-as-checkpoints-and-merge-branches-for-atomic-changes)\n",
    "- [Keep naming (of branches and commits) consistent, concise, and unique. Use descriptive naming where it matters.](#descriptive-tags-for-human-readability-and-unique-SHAs-for-identification)\n",
